## Hello there 👋

I'm Chris, a freelance software engineer from Germany, currently living in Japan.
While my main focus lately has been Android development using Kotlin, I have also
used C# and C++ professionally and regularly dive into new languages and
technologies on the side.

Some points about me:

- 🌍 My native language is German, but I'm fluent in English and starting to get
  conversational in Japanese.
- 🇯🇵 I've made the move to Japan in early 2025.
- ✍️ Currently, I'm working on creating a blog to write about my travels and
  language learning journey.
- 🔧 I mainly use [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/christianzoeller) for development,
  so this is where you'll find CI/CD pipelines.
- 👀 What I'm interested in:
    - 💻 Coding
    - 📓 Language Learning
    - ✈️ Travel
    - ⌚ Watches
    - 🎵 Music
    - 🎥 Movies
    - 🎮 Games
    - 🎦 Did I mention movies yet?
